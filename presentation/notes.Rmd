Introduction
----------

## HPV background
* HPVs cause 610K cancers
* main cause of cervical cancer
* E6 and E7 oncoproteins are transforming (inactivate TSGs P53 and RB1)
* early in infection, HPV replicates episomally
* Integration provides selective growth advantage, increased genomic instability
* increase in E6/E7 expression due to loss of E2
* associated with structural abnormalities

## HPV integration
* HPV infects keratinocytes in basal layer of epithelium
* Infected keratinocytes do not undergo terminal differentiation
* Virus replicates as episomal elements
* estimated 10% of cases a transforming type of HPV infection evolves. 
* characterized by the deregulation of viral oncogenes E6 and E7 in cycling cells 
* results in chromosomal instability and the accumulation of mutations

* Integration into host genome increases with severity
* Oncoproteins
* E6 up, p53 down (downregulates apoptosis pathway genes)
* E7 up, RB1 down (disrupts G1/S phase transition of cell cycle)


Results
----------

## Variability in HPV genomes and transcriptomes

* 2x100bp PE whole genome sequencing
* signif reads aligned to HPV in V+ samples
* clonal relationship b/c of unique homozygous viral mutations
* Variable coverage indicates breakpoints/rearrangements
* Total of 111 unique insertional breakpoints; 105 confirmed by PCR
* Some flanked missing viral segments (indicating loss at integration; ex. UM-SCC-47)
* Unique breakpoints, rearrangements
* E6/E7 oncogenes retained
* RNASeq positive for HPV viral genes (supp fig 2)

## HPV and the cellular genome

## Focal clustering of HPV integrants

## HPV insertions flank CNVs

## Resolving focal genomic amplifications and rearrangements

## HPV integrants disrupt cellular genes by multiple mechanisms

Discussion
----------

Issues
------

* Use of cell lines
* No mention of reports of HPV integration mechanism possibilities
* No mention (or identification) of HPV tandem arrays (head-to-tail concatemers)

Other DNA viruses (MCV)
--------------------

* We see similar signatures in exome sequencing data
